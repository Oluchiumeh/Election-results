# India General Election Results Analysis (SQL Project)
Data-Driven Insights into India's Electoral Landscape

## Project Overview
This project delves into the intricacies of India's general election results using SQL. By analyzing comprehensive datasets encompassing constituency details, state-wise results, and party performances, the project aims to uncover patterns and insights that shed light on the country's democratic processes.

## Database Schema
The analysis is structured around five primary tables:

Constituency_Details: Information about each parliamentary constituency, including identifiers and demographic data.

Constituency_Results: Detailed results at the constituency level, capturing candidate performances and vote counts.

State_Info: Metadata about each state, such as state codes and names.

State_Results: Aggregated results at the state level, summarizing party performances and vote shares.

Party_Results: Overall performance metrics for each political party across the nation.

## SQL Techniques Used
To extract meaningful insights, I used advanced SQL techniques, including:

- JOIN & INNER JOIN to combine related tables for complete insights

- WHERE clauses to filter specific conditions (e.g. top candidates, major parties)

- CASE and WHEN statements to classify voting outcomes or margin analysis

- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG) and GROUP BY to summarize complex data

- Aliases and nested queries for cleaner and optimized results

## Technical Implementation
Data Cleaning: Handled inconsistencies and standardized data formats to ensure accurate analysis.

SQL Queries: Crafted complex queries to extract meaningful insights, such as vote share percentages, seat distributions, and turnout rates.

Joins and Aggregations: Utilized SQL joins to combine data across tables and performed aggregations to summarize results at various levels.

## Key Insights
Voter Turnout: The average voter turnout across states was approximately 66%, with variations observed between urban and rural constituencies.

Party Performance: The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured a majority with 293 seats, while the opposition alliance INDIA garnered 234 seats.

Regional Dynamics: States like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra played pivotal roles, with significant seat allocations influencing the overall outcome.

Close Contests: Several constituencies witnessed narrow victory margins, highlighting competitive political landscapes in those regions.
